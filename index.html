                This week, I've been learning how to use ArcGIS Server layers to create maps with distinct symbols and colors. This is particularly important for choropleth maps where different areas need different fill colors to represent data. It was really useful to learn how to "categorize" numeric values into different classes with the renderers.

                One key aspect of my learning has been using ArcGIS Arcade expressions with popup templates. It's a helpful tool, especially when working with the ArcGIS JavaScript API. It allows me to design custom popups for my maps, making them interactive and easy to understand.
            </p>

                Finally, working in CodePen.io and having to publish the resulting application on my GitHub Pages has significantly increased my exposure to web development elements, further expanding my programming toolkit.
